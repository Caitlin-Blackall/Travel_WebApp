# Travel WebApp

*IN PROGRESS - July 2023*

## Idea
I have recently completed a Flask WebApp course and wanted to
put some of the skills I learnt into practice. I have always 
loved travelling and have often wanted an easy way to track 
recommendations, places I have been and to plan trips. This 
seemed like the perfect opportunity to create a WebApp for
this.

## Process
I knew that I wanted 4 different sections in this project - 
a home page, recommendations on where to go, a list 
of where I had been and a section dedicated to trip planning.

Each section needed a navigation bar as well as content 
set out in an easy-to-read way. I also wanted to include 
pictures where possible to make the website more attractive.

I used Jinga2 templates, FlaskForms and SQLAlchemy for the 
main functionality of the code. I then used HTML to render 
templates and for design elements, as well as CSS to keep a 
seperate styling sheet.

## Learning
### Challenges

**1. Using routes and render_template**
+ 

**2. Moving data across pages**
+ 



### New Skills
+ 

## Future Work
I would ideally like to be able to add pictures to the site 
as new trips were completed.

It would also be nice to further explore relational 
databases and utilise some of this functionality.
